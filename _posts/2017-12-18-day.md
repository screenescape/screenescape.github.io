To celebrate the holiday season Screen Escape would like to give you a special gift: 

> A one day screen escape for you, your friends and family!

How do you claim your gift? Simply start a conversation with your social group for the holiday season about dedicating one day to be a Screen Escape day.

You can determine a set of rules which suits your group. Here are some suggestions:

* Removing access to your screens is easier than becoming immune to their distractions so it is recommended to place all the screens somewhere that is physically out of mind.

* Fix the start and end time. Ideally for impact you should tun your escape for at least 24 hours.

* Plan your activities for the day -- you will be amazed how much time you have once the screens are off!

Wishing you a very happy Screen Escape this holiday season!
